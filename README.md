## Description
This project uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. It features a user-friendly interface where users can input health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI. The system provides predictions, aiding early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Prediction:** Utilizes a pre-trained ML model for accurate results.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for entering health data.
- **Healthcare Application:** Supports early detection of diabetes for better health management.

## How It Works
1. **Data Input:** Users provide key health parameters like glucose levels, age, BMI, and more.
2. **Model Processing:** The ML model analyzes the data and predicts the likelihood of diabetes.
3. **Output:** The system displays the prediction to the user.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Framework:** Flask/Streamlit (if applicable, mention the framework used)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for model training)
